1. 실험에 따라서 어떤 변수 저장할지 코드 짜기
2. network shortest path 보여지게 plot 짜기



- figure 1 : learning curve (1 time)
1.1 step vs energy
1.2 step vs goodput
1.3 step vs coonectivity ratio
1.4 step vs reward
1.5 step vs q value

- figure 2 : network formation, shortest path (1 time)
2.1 early step vs network formation 
2.2 intermediate step vs network formation
2.3 final step vs network formation

- figure 7: node tx_r variation (1 times, time series)
7.1 step vs node tx_r value over time with color coding (x-axis: node index, y-axis: time)

- figure 4 : network size change (1000 times save, one_dim = [7,12,17,22,27] --> averaged number of agents = 80, 320 720 1270 2000)
4.1 network size vs goodput
4.2 network size vs connectivity ratio
4.2 netowrk size vs energy

- figure 5: utility coefficient change (1000 times save, range: )
5.1 utility coefficient vs goodput
5.2 utiltiy coefficient vs connectivity ratio
5.3 utiltiy coefficient vs energy
--> 이건 보류

- figure 6: beta coefficient change (1000 times save, range: 0.0 0.15, 0.3)
6.1 beta vs goodput
6.2 beta vs connectivity ratio
6.3 beta vs energy


- figure 3 : performance comparison (1000 times save, one_dim = [5, 7] --> averaged number of agents = 28.8, 80)
3.3 network size vs goodput : DQN, Q table, Value iteration, TCLE --> 아마 이건 작은 숫자에 대해서 해야할듯 (VI, TCLE에서의 연산복잡도 때문)
