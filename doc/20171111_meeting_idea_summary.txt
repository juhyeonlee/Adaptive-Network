* Contents
- Evolutionary Network Formation for Dynamic Wireless Networks with Network Coding 논문 정리 및 Q&A
- paper idea 정리
- discussion 내용
	- state: the number of physically located node
	- action: difference of transmission range
	- reward(R): throughput (can be delayed feedback, should be implemented in simultation code)
	- utility: utility = u + w * R - (1 - w) *a

	- no transition probability (model-free, reinforment learning)
	- experiment setup: change beta(link failure rate), change node location
	- estimate Q(s,a) value based on throughput reward
	- if link failure rate is changed, adapt transmission range by using Q learning based on throughput reward
